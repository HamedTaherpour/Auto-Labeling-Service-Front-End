Role: Senior Full-Stack Frontend Engineer Task: Implement the Dataset Export, Release Versioning, and Download system. Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD).

Context: We have the Editor and Review workflows. Now, we need to close the "Data Lifecycle Loop" by allowing users to export their ground-truth data. This feature is inspired by V7 Darwin's immutable Export Versions.

Requirements:

Export Management Page (src/pages/exports):

Create a page to list all historical "Releases" (versions) of the dataset.

Show status badges for each export: Processing, Ready, Failed.

Display metadata for each release: Created at, Item count, Format, and Created by.

Create Export Feature (src/features/create-export):

Implement a modal to trigger a new Export.

Format Selection: Support formats found in the Postman collection (Darwin JSON, COCO, YOLO, Pascal VOC, CSV).

Filters: Add options to "Export only completed items" or "Include specific classes".

Worker Metadata: Toggle to include or exclude annotator/reviewer names in the export file.

API Integration (Shared Layer):

Map these endpoints from the attached Postman collection:

POST /api/v1/exports: To trigger a new export job.

GET /api/v1/exports: To fetch the list of versions for the current dataset.

GET /api/v1/exports/{id}: To get the signed download link for the ZIP file.

UI & Design (Chic/Modern):

Use a "Version History" timeline style.

Implement a progress indicator (Spinner or Progress Bar) for exports that are still being generated by the backend.

Use Lucide-react icons for file formats (e.g., Code icon for JSON, Table icon for CSV).

Entity (Export Release):

Define the ExportVersion model in src/entities/export-release. Ensure it follows the FSD standard.

Instructions:

Analyze the Postman collection for exports and releases endpoints.

Start by creating the export-release entity and its public API.

Implement the create-export feature with the format selection logic.

Assemble the ExportsPage using FSD widgets.
